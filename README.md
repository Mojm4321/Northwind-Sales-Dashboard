## Critical Insights 
### Financial Performance
Northwind has achieved sales volume of £1.35million with a substantial profit margin of £1.27million, reflecting a highly efficient sales and cost management process, as the company is able to maintain a good profit on each sale, while keep cost of the product low. The high profit margin of 93.45% further emphasises the pricing strateigies are made appealing to consumers to to maintain brand loyalty, whilst maximising operational efficiency through inventory management,so meeting customers exact needs and not overcrowding customer needs.

While the overall financial performance is strong, as a business it is important to find opportunities to further enhancy profit margins by optimising other areas of the business, in this case maybe  freigth costs and discount strategies. 

### Top performers in Sales
Employees like Margaret Peacock, Janet Leverling and Nancy Davolio are top sales performers, indicating their strategies and methods are highly effective in terms of marketing the product to consumers. For example they may have built strong customer relationships through personalised services providing tailored recommendations to meet individual needs and consistently following up with customers to ensure satisifcation is met and build long term relaitonships. Replicating their approaches could prove beneficial for improving the overall team performance.

However, the reliance of few top performers may indicate a disparity in the sales skills across the team. Identifying why certain individuals excel above others and how their success can be scaled across the entire salesforce is crucial.

### Discount Strategies
There is a significant variation in the total discounts given to customers, which indicates a flexible approach to cutomer incentives.

 However, this variation could lead to inconsistencies in customer experience and potential profit erosion if not managed properly.  

### Geographical Sales Distribution
The sales are distributed across multiple regions, with more activity in North America and Europe. This indicates a strong market presence and diversified revenue streams.

However, there are untapped potential in other regions showing no revenue. Identifiying and targeting these areas for expansion could drive further growth, more profits and increase market share.

### Freight Costs Distribution
Freight costs are distributed among United Package (43.49%), Federal Shipping (31.59%), and Speedy Express (24.92%). This distribution suggested a diversified logistics approach, which can mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single carrier,as one single carrier can assume power and raise costs knowing you have no one else to go to if demand increases.

With United Package taking a high proportion of freight costs, there may be opportunites to negotiate better rate as demand increases in the future. Also the idea of seeking alternative carriers to reduce costs and improve profitability is another approach that could be targeted.

### Average Quantity Sold
There is a strong corellation between the fact Horst Kloss and Roland Mendel buying the most quantities of products as they receive substaintially more discounts compared to to others. This may guarantee constant revenue amongst their biggest customers due to the level of service and peddle stool they are being put on to feel some sort of importance. 

This however may make other customers feel like they are not receiving the same sort of service and they abandon the product to go to another brand that thye feel appreciates their pruchasing. Therfore, there is potential to standardise these successful techniques across the team that they are using on the top customers, to improve the average quantities sold, so more employees can replicate the sucess of top perfomers.
