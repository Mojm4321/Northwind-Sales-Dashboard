# Northwind Sales Insights: Customer Focus and Profit Margins By Jolly Madamedon

## Critical Insights 
### Financial Performance
Northwind has achieved a sales volume of £1.35 million with a substantial profit margin of £1.27 million. This illustrates the company's highly efficient sales and cost management processes, enabling it to maintain a massive profits per sale, while keeping product costs low. The impressive profit margin of 93.45% further emphasises the effectiveness of Northwind's pricing strategies, which appeal to customers and cultivates brand loyalty. 

Despite this strong financial performance, it is important to identify opportunities to further enhancy profit margins. In particular, optimising other areas of the business such as freight costs and discount strategies could bring significant improvements. 

### Top performers in Sales
Employees like Margaret Peacock, Janet Leverling and Nancy Davolio are top sales performers, indicating their strategies and methods are highly effective in terms of marketing the product to consumers. For example they may have built strong customer relationships through personalised services providing tailored recommendations to meet individual needs, and consistently following up with customers to ensure satisifcation and build long term relationships. Replicating their approaches could prove beneficial for improving the overall team performance.

However, the reliance on a few top performers may indicate a weakness in sales skills across the team. Identifying why certain individuals excel above others and how their success can be scaled across the entire salesforce is crucial.

### Discount Strategies
There is a significant variation in the total discounts given to customers, which indicates a flexible approach to customer incentives. However, this variation could lead to inconsistencies in customer experience and potential profit erosion if not managed properly because they can eat into profit margins, resulting in lower profits even if sales volumes remain high.

### Geographical Sales Distribution
Sales are distributed across multiple regions, with more activity in North America and Europe, indicating a strong market presence and diversified revenue streams.

However, there is untapped potential in other regions currently showing no revenue. Identifiying and targeting these areas for expansion could drive further growth, increase profits and guarantee more market share.

### Freight Costs Distribution
Freight costs are distributed among United Package (43.49%), Federal Shipping (31.59%), and Speedy Express (24.92%), suggesting a diversified logistics approach that mitigates risks associated with reliance on a single carrier. Relying on a single carrier can result in increased costs if the carrier raises rates due to a lack of alternatives. When the carrier is aware of this fact some may choose to exploit this.

With United Package handling a high proportion of freight costs, there may be opportunites to negotiate better rate as demand increases in the future. Also, seeking alternative carriers to reduce costs and improve profitability is another approach worth considering.

### Average Quantity Sold
There is a strong correlation between Horst Kloss and Roland Mendel purchasing the most quantities of products and receive substaintially more discounts compared to to others. This may guarantee consistent revenue from these major customers due to the level of service and preferential treatment they receive, making them feel valued.

However, this approach may cause other customers feel neglected, potentially leading them to switch to another brand they feel appreciate their business as this is they're hard earned money they are choosing to spend with the business. Therfore, there is potential to teach the successful techniques used on top customers across the entire team. This could improve the average quantities sold and enable more employees to replicate the success of top performers.

## Recommendations

## Leverage Top Sales Strategies
Analyse the sales strategies  of top performers like Margaret Peacock and Janet Leverling to develop a training program for the entire sales team. This would provide further insight on how to boost overall sales performance and understand how to meet the needs of the customers, whilst maintaining profit as a top priority.

## Expand High-Performing Regions
